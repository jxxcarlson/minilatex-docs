\begin{abstract} 
\italic{MiniLateX is a no-setup subset of LaTeX that can be rendered on the fly to HTML.   One can use it to build web apps with true HTML display viewable on any device from smart phone to tablet to desktop.  Typesetting occurs in real time, and error messages are displayed in-line in the rendered text. MiniLaTeX documents can be exported to standard LaTeX.

We describe (a) MiniLaTeX the language, (b) the main features of the the document management application
\href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}, and (c) some of the technical work required to implement an on-the-fly LaTeX-to-Html compiler.}
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}

 MiniLaTeX is a no-setup subset of LaTeX that comes with an on-the-fly compiler to HTML:

\begin{itemize}

\item \strong{No setup.}  Just begin typing.  No preamble with \code{\bs{usepackage}} statements, \code{\bs{begin}\texarg{document}}, etc., is needed.


\item \strong{On-the-fly.}  A typical editor for MiniLaTeX presents two windows.  On the left is the source text, on the right is the rendered text.  Changes to the source text are immediately reflected in the rendered text window.

\item \strong{Errors.} Errors are immediately flagged in color and in place in the rendered text.


\end{itemize}

The compiler is written in \href{https://elm-lang.org}{Elm}, a strictly typed language of pure functions.  Elm is a good language for writing MiniLaTeX apps because (a) it is designed for building web applications and (b) it has an excellent, high performance  \href{https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/}{library of parser combinators} akin to Haskell's \code{parsec}.


\subheading{Apps}

Below are two links to  apps that use  MiniLaTeX.  

\begin{itemize}

\item \strong{\href{https://demo.minilatex.app}{Demo.minilatex.app}}: a simple no-signin app for experimenting with MiniLaTeX.  Feel free to edit the text you find there, or clear it and write something new.

\item \strong{\href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app/g/34}{Minilatex.lamdera.app/g/34}}:  This link takes you to some class notes
hosted on \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}.

\end{itemize}

\href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{Minilatex.lamdera.app}, while still in alpha test, is a full content-management system for creating, editing, and distributing MiniLaTeX documents.

\begin{itemize}

\item \strong{Guest access.} Sign in to \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}
as \blue{guest} with password \blue{minilatex} to explore documents that have been made public by their authors.  Both the source and rendered text are available, so you can see how MiniLaTeX documents are written. 

\item \strong{Registered user} Create and edit documents on a dektop computer or tablet. Works in read-only mode on smart phones.

\item \strong{Smart phone.} Use in read-only mode on a smart phone. Students can read class notes and problem sets this way.

\end{itemize}


\section{Features of MiniLaTeX}

Below is a summary of MiniLaTeX features. See \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app/g/21}{the manual} for more details.

\begin{itemize}

\item \strong{Macros and Environments.} Environments include theorem, problem, definition, etc., as well as equation, align, verbatim, and more.  The \code{\bs{maketitle}}, \code{\bs{section}}. \code{\bs{cite}} and \code{\bs{eqref}} macros and many others work as expected.  Unimplemented macros are rendered verbatim, but colored red to indicate their status.

\item \strong{Macro definitions.} One can define both math-mode and text-mode macros in MiniLaTeX.  

\item \strong{Export.} MiniLaTeX documents can be exported to standard LaTeX, complete with the necessary \code{\bs{usepackage}} statements, \code{\bs{begin}\texarg{document}}, \code{\bs{end}\texarg{document}}, and any needed macro definitions.  Exported documents are ready to process with \code{\bs{pdflatex}}.  Here is \href{https://noteimages.s3.amazonaws.com/anharmonic_oscillator.pdf}{an example} of an exported document compiled to PDF using TeXShop.


\item \strong{Images} The macro \code{\bs{image}\texarg{URL}\texarg{{Caption}\texarg{Format}} is used to place images in a MiniLaTeX document.  See \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app/g/21}{the manual} for examples. 
Provision is made to render images in exported documents.  There is, in addition, an \code{svg} environment for rendering SVG images from SVG source code. 

\item \strong{Unicode.} MiniLaTeX accepts unicode (UTF-8) input. More needs to be done to accomodate unicode in exported documents.

\item \strong{Paragraph-centric.} MiniLaTeX is \blue{paragraph-centric}, meaning that the smallest unit of recompilation is the \italic{logical paragraph}.  A logical paragraph is either an ordinary paragraph or an outer begin-end block.  

\item \strong{Additions.} 
Besides the \code{\bs{image}} command, there are various other commands that exist in MiniLaTeX but not plain LaTeX.  These commands are provide with suitable macro definitions on export so that a MiniLaTeX document can always be compiled with standard LaTeX Tools.  Here are some examples.  Text can be colored blue using the \code{\bs{blue}} macro: \italic{I am feeling \blue{blue}}.  Text can be highlighted using the \code{\bs{highlight}} macro.  The teacher said that \highlight{all work on our class project is due by October 1}.
There is also a \code{\bs{strike}} macro: Please delete this \strike{very bad word}.  For a complete list of additions, see \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app/g/21}{minilatex.lamdera.app/g/21}.



\end{itemize}

 An important part of the MiniLaTeX project is to properly define the subset of LaTeX to be supported.  The current rule of thumb for this is "good enough to write my lecture notes and class hand-outs."  Feedback on this issue is much appreciated (jxxcarlson at gmail).


\section{Features of minilatex.lamdera.app}


\subsection{Collaboration} 

To add a collaborator to a document, click on the \blue{Collaborators} button in the footer.  Enter collaborators in the resulting popup window one collaborator per line.  Collaborators may edit a document synchronoulsy or asynchronously.  In the former case, when both authors are online, changes by one author are reflected a fraction of a second later in the other others app.  To facilitate collaboration, there is a chat window (lower right, in footer).  The chat feature needs a good deal more work.

Collaborators can attach notes to a shared document using the \code{\bs{editnote}} command.  Thus 

\begin{verbatim}
\editnote{Mary}{Joe, please check proof, Thm 4.5}
\end{verbatim}

renders as 

\editnote{Mary}{Joe, please check proof, Thm 4.5}

\subsection{Sharing documents}

\subsection{Github integration}

\subsection{Links and Index Documents}

In addition to the familiar \code{\bs{href}} macro, there are \code{\bs{xlink}}  and \code{\bs{ilink}}.  The \code{\bs{xlink}} macro 
is used to make a link from one document to another in \code{minilatex.lambdera.app}.   Thus, one can say 
\code{\bs{xlink}\texarg{21}\texarg{Manual}}, which is rendered as \xlink{21}{Manual}, to make a link on this document to the Manual.

The \code{\bs{ilink}} macro is similar.  It has the same syntax, but is used in constructing a page of links which functions as a table of contents or \italic{index document} for a master document, aka a book.  For an example, see \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app/g/34}{these class notes}. It is worthwhile looking at the source to see how it is done.





\section{The MiniLaTeX Compiler}


LaTeX documents consist of snippets of math-mode LaTeX (the equations and formulas) and text-mode LaTeX (everything else, e.g. section headings, lists, and environments of various knds).  The strategy that makes writing a compiler that transforms MiniLaTeX to HTML feasible is divide and conquer.  Parse the the document, identifying the math elements as such, but not transforming them.  Then render the resulting abstract syntax tree (AST) to Html, again passing on the math elements.  Finally, have \href{https://mathjax.org}{MathJax} or \href{https://katex.org}{KaTeX} render the math elements. 

\strong{Video}: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmDA7iziSgs&t=15s}{Making a LaTeX-to-Html parser in Elm}

An abstract syntax tree is a tree of things that expresses a grammatical analysis of the source text. It is akin to what one gets when one diagrams a sentence in English class, something the present author did in Marge Lee's sophomore class in high school.  More on this later.

\image{https://noteimages.s3.amazonaws.com/sentence-diagram.png}{Diagramming sentences}{width: 400}

The MiniLaTeX compiler consists of two parts, a \italic{parser} and a \italic{renderer}.  The first is a function

$$
parse: \text{Source text} \to \text{AST}
$$

The second is a function

$$
render: \text{AST} \to \text{HTML}
$$

Here we are simplifying somewhat because of various optimizations that are needed, but this is the general idea.  The compiler is the composite of these two functions:

$$
compile   = render \circ parse
$$

In designing a parser, one generally starts with a grammar.  However, there is no published grammar for LaTeX or for TeX, so one has to improvise.  The approach taken with MiniLaTeX was first to imagine the type of the AST, then to write a parser using parser combinators.  The parser then consists of a bunch of functions which call one another.  They are in rough correspondence with the productions of a grammar, and so one can write down a grammar after the fact. Ideally one should have written the grammar, then the parser, but real life is often messy.

\subsection{AST}

Every value in a statically typed language like Haskell, ML, or Elm, has a \italic{type}.  Below is the type of AST for the MiniLaTeX compiler.

\begin{listing}
type LatexExpr
    = LXString String
    | Comment String
    | Item Int LatexExpression
    | InlineMath String
    | DisplayMath String
    | SMacro String (List LatexExpr) (List LatexExpr) LatexExpr
    | Macro String (List LatexExpr) (List LatexExpr)
    | Environment String (List LatexExpr) LatexExpr
    | LatexList (List LatexExpr)
    | NewCommand String Int LatexExpr
    | LXError (List (DeadEnd Context Problem))
\end{listing}

Below is a series of examples that give an idea of how the parser works.  The examples are generated using a command-line tool that applies the parser to a string of text supplied by the user.

\begin{verbatim}
> Pythagoras
LXString "Pythagoras"

> \strong{Pythagoras}
Macro "strong" [] [LatexList [LXString "Pythagoras"]]

> \strong{Pythagoras} says that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
Macro "strong" [] [LatexList [LXString "Pythagoras"]]
  , LXString "says  that "
  , InlineMath "a^2 + b^2 = c^2"
\end{verbatim}


Below is the top-level parser function.  Note the close correspondence
with the AST type.  The \code{lazy} function is needed for recursion.  The \code{oneOf} function is a combinator that takes a list of parrsers and produces a new parser from them.  The resulting parser operates as follows: try the first parser.  If it succeeds, return the result.  If not, try the next parser.  And so on.  If the list is exhausted without success, return an error.

\begin{listing}
latexExpression : LXParser LatexExpr
latexExpression =
    oneOf
        [ texComment
        , displayMathDollar
        , displayMathBrackets
        , inlineMath
        , newcommand
        , macro
        , smacro
        , words
        , lazy (\_ -> environment)
        ]
\end{listing}

Below is the parser for macros.  It uses a \italic{parser pipeline} in the following way.   First, find the name of the macro, then the list of optional arguments, then the list of  actual arguments, then eat any whitespace (spaces, newlines).  Second, feed the values found in the order found to the constructor \code{Macro} for the \code{LatexExpr} type.  In this example, \code{whitespace} is a parser for white space, which can come in different flavors depending on context e.g., spaces only or spaces and newlines.

\begin{listing}
macro : LXParser () -> LXParser LatexExpr
macro =
    succeed Macro
        |= macroName
        |= itemList optionalArg
        |= itemList arg
        |. whitespace
\end{listing}

One can continue down the rabbit hole, explaining the parsers and \code{macroName}, \code{optionalArg},  \code{arg} and the combinators \code{itemList}, etc, but we stop here.  What is important to understand is that there are really only three things in something like the MiniLaTeX parser: primitive parsers, combinators that choose among alternatives, and combinators that sequence other parsers.

\subsection{Rendering}


The top-level renderiing function is much like the top-level parsing functions. It analyzes the type of a LatexExpr and dispatches the appropriater renderer, which may in turn call other rendering functions, including the top level one. And so on, down the rabbit hole of function calls we go.


\begin{listing}
render : String -> LatexState -> LatexExpr -> Html msg
render source latexState latexExpr =
    case latexExpression of
        Comment str ->
            Html.p [] [ Html.text "" ]

        Macro name optArgs args ->
            renderMacro source latexState name optArgs args

        Item level latexExpr ->
            renderItem source latexState level latexExpr

        InlineMath str ->
            Html.span [] [ 
              inlineMathText 
                latexState 
               (evalStr  latexState.macroDict str) ]

        DisplayMath str ->
            Html.span [] [ 
              displaMathText 
                latexState 
               (evalStr  latexState.macroDict str) ]

        Environment name args body ->
            renderEnvironment source latexState name args body

        LatexList latexList ->
            renderLatexList source latexState latexList
\end{listing}

\subsection{Code}

Code for the MiniLaTeX compiler as well as the demo app is found at \href{https://github.com/jxxcarlson/meenylatex}{github.com/jxxcarlson/meenylatex}.  The strange name is to reserve the name \blue{github.com/jxxcarlson/minilatex} for a future stable version with a polished API.  The repository just mentioned also contains simple demos t show how to use the compiler.

The code for the \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app} is at \href{https://github.com/jxxcarlson/lamdera-minilatex-app}{github.com/jxxcarlson/lamdera-minilatex-app}.

All code is open source. The web application \href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}  is offered as a service. It is free for now. The intent is to (a) keep it free for students, (b) eventually charge a small annual fee for other users, (c) have institutional licenses. Bills have to be paid and code has to be iimproved and maintained!  Note that guests may browse the site without establishing an account.

\section{Plans}

I am very interested in feedback from the community regarding features, bugs, etc.  Of special interest is the subset of LaTeX used: what should it be? 

Some plans:

\begin{enumerate}

\item An image uploader.  With this in place, users can post images on a server and use the resulting URL to place images in their MiniLaTeX documents. 

\item An IDE/editor with syntax highlighting, sync of source and rendered text,  etc.



\end{enumerate}
