\section{Browser compatibiity}

The app works well in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Min.   In Safari, the display is messed up.

\section{Collaboration}

\subsection{Adding and removing collaborators}

Press the \blue{Collaborators} button in the footer to raise the collaborators popup list.  Enter collaborators by user name one per line.


\subsection{Notes to collaborators}

If you say this:

\begin{verbatim}
\attachNote{HD}{Hey, this is a good first draft.
But I would refer to Blowenpuff's article on
quantum computing in the introduction.}
\end{verbatim}

It is rendered like this:

\attachNote{HD}{Hey, this is a good first draft.
But I would refer to Blowenpuff's article on
quantum computing in the introduction.}

\section{Exporting to LaTeX}

Use the \blue{Export} button in the footer.  The exported document will be saved in the Downloads folder unless you tell your computer otherwise.  If your document has images, a button \blue{Images} will appear to the right of \blue{Export}.  Click on that button to bring up a window that lists the images in your document.  Right-click on these images to download them.  They should be stored in folder \blue{image} in the same place as your exported document.
