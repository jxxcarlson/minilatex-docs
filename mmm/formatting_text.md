# Formatting text

## The usual

- Italic text, *like this,* is enclosed by asterisks: `*like this*`

- Bold text, **like this,** is enclosed by asterisks: `**like this**`

## The extras

Math+Markdown is a variant of Markdown that supports mathematicsl formulas written in the usual LaTeX style, as well as a few other features.

- Text can be colored: @blue[flower] or @red[rose].  Just say `@blue[flower] ` or `@red[rose]`.

- Text can be highlighted @highlight[if you think that it is important] to do that. Just say `@highlight[if you think ...] `

- Text can be struck if we don't like it, ~~like this~~.  Just say `~~like this~~`
