## Articles

Over fourty articles on programming in [Medium.com](https://jxxcarlson.medium.com/).

## Projects

I have worked as an independent software developer on a number of projects, of which three are listed below. Most are written in Elm, a statically typed functional language.  


- [Minilatex.lamdera.app](https://minilatex.lamdera.app): A web-based content-management app which provides an integrated system for creating, editing, and publishing technical documents writen in LaTeX for fields such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. This app uses the MiniLaTeX and MathMarkdown libraries listed below, as well as two servers written in Haskell: one for producing PDF files from LaTeX source, the other for recording and reporting on analytics data generated by the MiniLaTeX app. A project total of 30,000 lines of code.

- [Algorithmic Musical Composition](https://jxxcarlson.io/posts/2020-11-19-generative-art-music/): Three compositions using Haskell.  Comments on code and compositional technique. along with linked audio files.

- [Generative 2-Part Drum Music](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/drumlanguage.html): Works only on Firefox.  Written in Elm + Javascript.

### Libraries

Thirteen open-source libraries listed on the Elm package manager, among which:

- [MiniLaTeX](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/meenylatex/latest/): An on-the-fly compiler of LaTeX to Html

- [MathMarkdown](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/math-markdown/latest/): An on-the-fly compiler of Markdown to Html which supports LaTeX equations and formulas as well as various other extensions, e.g., SVG images and poetry.

- [elm-tar](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-tar/latest/): An implementation of the unix tar archive program

- [elm-stat](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-stat/latest/): A library of statistical functions

- [tree-extra](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/tree-extra/latest/) :A library of functions for working with rose trees (multiway trees).
